# Basic Concept Definitions
## I. Mathematical
### 1.1 Real Number
A real number is a number that corresponds one-to-one with a unique point on a number line. This line is called the real number line. All real numbers together form the set of real numbers, denoted by $\mathbb{R}$.

### 1.2 Complex Number
A complex number is the sum of a real number and a imaginary number. The real number is called the real part of the complex number, and the imaginary number is called the imaginary part. An imaginary number is the product of a real number and the imaginary unit $i$, which is defined by the following equation:
$$
i = \sqrt{-1}
$$
The concept of the imaginary unit $i$ originated from efforts to find solutions of high-degree polynomial equations, where negative square roots $sqrt{-1}$ appeared but could not be represented by any real number. The same reason, there must be more than one axis used to express complex numbers.
